# Analysis-of-Submetered-Household-Electric-Power-Consumption
Derive insights from the sub-metered energy consumption data set that could be used as an incentive to potential home buyers that may be interested in “smart home” technology.


# Deliverables
1. Sub-metered energy consumption data that provides enough granularity to uncover trends in behavior or appliance performance.
2. Identification of peak energy usage can be identified allowing for the potential to modify behavior to take advantage of off-peak electricity rates.
3. Longer-term patterns of energy usage that can be used to predict future usage with the potential to flag appliance degradation or unusual energy consumption.
